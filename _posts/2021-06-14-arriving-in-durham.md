It's Sunday, and the Freedom Tour has arrived! And what a beautiful sight to arrive to...

Sunshine, rowing, and smiling faces.

We spent our first night camped up by [The Sands](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Sands,+Durham+DH1+1LH/) in East Durham and no sooner had we got our provocative, [painted doors](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQD1_PiKeQN/) out, than we had people gagging to know what the Freedom Tour is about.

The sign-ups flew onto our hastily-drawn sign-up sheet while we juggled entertaining and cooking a nutritious, vegan bolognese.

Then came Monday, or Day One, and we headed to the heart of Durham. We burst onto [the scene](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQHS6xJJpVG/) with a spectacular entrance (not pictured), jumped out and put our best [canvassing heads](https://www.ted.com/talks/david_fleischer_how_to_fight_prejudice_through_policy_conversations) on.

If the tour continues like this, we are in for a treat.
