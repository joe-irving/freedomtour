The tour has arrived! And what a beautiful sight to arrive to.

Sun, river and smiling faces.

We spent our first night camped up by [The Sands](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Sands,+Durham+DH1+1LH/) in East Durham and no sooner had we got our provocative, [painted doors](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQD1_PiKeQN/) out, than we had people gagging to know what the Freedom Tour is about.

The sign-ups flew onto our hastily-drawn sign-up sheet while we juggled entertaining and cooking a nutritious, vegan bolognese.

If the tour continues like this, we are in for a treat.
