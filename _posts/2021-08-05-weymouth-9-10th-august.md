The Freedom Tour is in Weymouth. Below are our plans.

## Today, 6pm - The Crisis Talk

The [Crisis Talk](freedomtour.uk/crisis-talk) will take place at **Weymouth Beach**. Everybody welcome.

We are holding a space where people can learn about local campaigns that are shaping different spaces and services in Weymouth. Everyone who attends is invited to be in a discussion group that will feedback its conclusions to the wider assembly.

The aim of our conversations is for us to learn from those we speak to, exchange new viewpoints and paradigms, and ultimately invite people to the [Crisis Talk](freedomtour.uk/crisis-talk) at 6pm on Tuesday.

Thanks to all the locals that are helping out. Special thanks to Laura Baldwin.
