The Freedom Tour is in Weymouth. Below are our plans.

## Monday

![](/assets/images/pxl_20210809_101548142.jpg)

The aim of our conversations is for us to learn from those we speak to, exchange new viewpoints and paradigms, and ultimately invite people to the [Crisis Talk](freedomtour.uk/crisis-talk) at 6pm on Tuesday.

Thanks to all the locals that are helping out. Special thanks to Laura Baldwin.

#### Press Coverage

A few publications decided to write something about our visit:

Dorset Eye - [‘Freedom Tour’ arrives in Weymouth for Crisis Talks](https://dorseteye.com/freedom-tour-arrives-in-weymouth-for-crisis-talks/)

Dorset Echo - ['Crisis talk' on Weymouth Beach calling for action on poverty and climate change](https://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/19501304.crisis-talk-weymouth-beach-calling-action-poverty-climate-change/)

Planet Radio - [What's next? Campaigners in Weymouth for 'Crisis Talk'](https://planetradio.co.uk/greatest-hits/dorset/news/campaigners-in-weymouth-for-crisis-talk/)

We also were fortunate enough to be shared on a local Facebook page. All publicity is good publicity, they say!
