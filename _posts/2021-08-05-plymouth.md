The Freedom Tour is in Plymouth!

**UPDATE**: Our Crisis Talk is no longer at The Plot due to size issues. Saturday's event will be outside the Guildhall unless we can find somewhere inside. Same time of 3pm.

## Friday

We have set up our van outside the Guildall.

We have our tea urns, biscuits, smiles and flyers. We will be engaging people in conversation to find out what they think about crisis and the state of Plymouth within the wider UK and human condition. What gives them hope and what are they wanting to change.

The aim in our conversations is for us to learn from those we speak to, exchange new viewpoints and paradigms, and ultimately invite people to Saturday's [Crisis Talk](freedomtour.uk/crisis-talk).

## Saturday

#### Morning

We will continue our outreach somewhere in Plymouth.

#### 3pm - The Crisis Talk

**UPDATE:** The Crisis Talk will take place at **Jigsaw park**. Check here or the facebook event incase things change again.
