The Freedom Tour is in Plymouth!

**UPDATE**: Our Crisis Talk is no longer at The Plot due to size issues and not outside the Guildhall due to clashing with Pride. It will be at **Jigsaw Park at the same time of 3pm**.

## Friday

We have parked up our van and continued the journey on foot. We are walking around the area North of Royal Parade finding people to talk to.

We have our smiles and flyers. We will be engaging people in conversation to find out what they think about crisis and the state of Plymouth within the wider UK and human condition. What gives them hope and what are they wanting to change.

The aim in our conversations is for us to learn from those we speak to, exchange new viewpoints and paradigms, and ultimately invite people to Saturday's [Crisis Talk](freedomtour.uk/crisis-talk).

## Saturday

#### Morning

We will continue our outreach somewhere in Plymouth.

#### 3pm - The Crisis Talk

**UPDATE:** The Crisis Talk will take place at **Jigsaw Park**. Check here or [the facebook event ](https://www.facebook.com/events/1003558423726725)in case things change again.
