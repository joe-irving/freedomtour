## Friday

We parked up our van and continued the journey on foot. We walked around the area surrounding the Sundial, finding people to talk to.

With our smiles and flyers, we engaged people in conversation to find out what they think about crisis and the state of Plymouth within the wider UK and human condition. What gives them hope and what are they wanting to change.

The aim in our conversations is for us to learn from those we speak to, exchange new viewpoints and paradigms, and ultimately invite people to Saturday's [Crisis Talk](freedomtour.uk/crisis-talk).

## Saturday

#### Morning

We will continue our outreach somewhere in Plymouth.

**UPDATE:** The Crisis Talk will take place at **Jigsaw Park**. Check here or [the facebook event ](https://www.facebook.com/events/1003558423726725)in case things change again.
