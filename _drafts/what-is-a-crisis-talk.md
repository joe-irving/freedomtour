As we are travelling around, our aim is to foster dialogue and conversation. We want to listen and learn, as much as we want to talk and teach.

I believe that the answers to our problems are in all of us, because the answers are very human and can be found in our lived experience.

The Crisis Talk helps us to bring people to the table, asking them to share which of the intersecting crises is impinging on them and what it would mean for them to be able to make headway into challenging their crisis.

### So What Happens?

First of all, we put in the ground work: doing research on where we are and finding a suitable location, inviting groups that are also engaged in a struggle along, and (most importantly) conversing with strangers on the street to hear about their take on the World and invite them to the Crisis Talk.  
Next, we rock up in our beautiful blue van at a suitable location at the planned time and start cooking some delicious free food and create a fun atmosphere... think music and warm smiles and the slight electric-tingly-feeling that tells you something special is about to happen.

### What does the Freedom Tour get out of it?

Apart from a social buzz, warm sense of community, and the lingering feeling that something has been set in motion?

That's it really: we get to be around people in a space created to help each of us be open, connected, supported and human.
