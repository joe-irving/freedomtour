As we are travelling around, our aim is to foster dialogue and conversation. We want to listen and learn, as much as we want to talk and teach.

I believe that the answers to our problems are in all of us, because the answers are very human and can be found in our lived experience.

The Crisis Talk helps us to bring people to the table, asking them to share which of the intersecting crises is impinging on them and what it would mean for them to be able to make headway into challenging their crisis.
