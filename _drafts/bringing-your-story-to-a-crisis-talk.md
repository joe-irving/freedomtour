## Who are we inviting to tell a call-to-action story at the Crisis Talk?

We are reaching out to progressive groups that have highlighted crises or issues and are taking direct action to target the root of these problems, or building community power and cohesion for more caring and resilient communities.

## Where does this fit in the Crisis Talk?

The crisis talk has 4 main sections:

* Introduction/input - Setting the space, ground rules, inviting attendees to testify.
* Deliberation - 30 mins in groups engaging with one or more questions
* Feedback/Harvest - The main points from each of the groups are returned to the wider assembly.
* **Call-to-action stories - Campaign groups tell the assembly about the crisis they are facing and responding to.**

All attendees will naturally talk about their crises in the deliberation phase, but the 4th phase is a time where pre-selected speakers have a 5-10 minute slot telling the whole group about the crises they face and what can be done about them.

## Why do we want campaigns speaking at the Crisis Talk?
