## Who are we inviting to bring a Call-To-Action?

We are reaching out to progressive groups that have highlighted crises or issues and are taking direct action to target the root of these problems, or building community power and cohesion for more caring and resilient communities.

## Where does this fit in the Crisis Talk?

The crisis talk has 4 main sections:

* Introduction/input - Setting the space, ground rules, inviting attendees to testify.
* Deliberation - 30 mins in groups engaging with one or more questions
* Feedback/Harvest - The main points from each of the groups are returned to the wider assembly.
* **Call-to-action stories - Campaign groups tell the assembly about the crisis they are facing and responding to.**

All attendees will naturally talk about their crises in the deliberation phase, but the **4th phase** is a time where pre-selected speakers have a **5-10 minute slot** telling the whole group about the crises they face and what can be done about them.

## Why do campaigns bring their Call-To-Action?

There are many reasons, but here are the big ones:

* **Show shared humanity** in their struggle - people are sharing a bite to eat and a 30 minute chat, this leads one to put value in the concerns of other campaigns even if they don't directly affect you. This can lead someone from being ignorant or unmoved to a position of support for a cause. \[See [Deep Canvassing](https://www.ted.com/talks/david_fleischer_how_to_fight_prejudice_through_policy_conversations "Deep Canvassing TED Talk")\]
* **Educate people that are hard to reach** - the Crisis Talk is inclusive in a way that exposes many non-progressive or radical people to those that they wouldn't otherwise meet. This is a rare way to get certain worlds to collide in a constructive way.
* **Recruiting for a campaign** - some attendees sign up to a mailing list of a campaign or offer up time as a volunteer/activist. This may be a totally new world for them and their first taste of activism. Be gentle!

## What do we think could result from a campaign speaking at the Crisis Talk?

## Many thanks to those who have given a call-to-action so far
