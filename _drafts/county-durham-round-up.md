What a week to start the tour with!

4 days of speaking to the good people of Durham, Peterlee, Seaham, X and X. A jam-packed tour of the collieries with [Haswell Parish Councillor, Chris Hood](https://haswell.parish.durham.gov.uk/councillors/councillor-chris-hood/). Climaxing with one big-fat, community-connecting chat-in-the-park!

And what a chat-in-the-park it was! We asked the question "X" and were \[emotion\] by what we learned. Particular challenges in getting the space up and running included \[X\], but we pulled it off with \[X\] people in socially-distant attendance.

The chat was followed by some talks from speakers talking about ...

We started off the week as a group of 6 in our delightfully conspicuous blue van and our support car. Soon, we were joined by our friend, Frankie, and then another addition with Liv, a second-year Durham student who saw a bright future with the tour.

Here are some of my favourite posts: [\[1\]](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQHS6xJJpVG/) [\[2\]](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQOApwrpwSW/) [\[3\]](https://www.tiktok.com/@freedomtour21/video/6973621561584618758)
