### What a week to start the tour with!

4 days of speaking to the good people of Durham, Peterlee, Seaham, Easlington and Haswell. A jam-packed tour of the collieries with independent [Durham County Councillor](https://democracy.durham.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=8068) and [Haswell Parish Councillor, Chris Hood](https://haswell.parish.durham.gov.uk/councillors/councillor-chris-hood/). This week climaxed with one big-fat, community-connecting chat-in-the-park!

And what a chat-in-the-park it was! We asked the question "How might we come out of all these crises better than before?". Particular challenges in getting the space up and running included a quiet speaker system and the allure of fish and chips over our free dhal, but we pulled it off with around 25 people in socially-distant attendance for the group dialogue.

The question generated the following outputs from the group:

Clearly, human connection and community power were on people's minds after being held in their groups for 30 minutes. Amazingly the suggestions will have received wide support in their groups through the power of dialogue and speaking to one another from a place of equality.

Mamoud joined us to explain the ongoing fight against the proposed Hassockfield detention center.

The campaign's details are as follows:

### A changing team

Going into week 2 we have some new faces. Liv, a second year Durham student saw the beauty of our ways and has joined the gang. Plus seasoned campaigner Linda is now with us to have some world-changing conversations in Hull and Grimsby.

As social-media amateurs, we dipped our collective toe in [Tiktok ](https://www.tiktok.com/@freedomtour21)and tried to maximise our content on [Instagram](agram.com/freedomtour21/). Here are some of my favourite posts: [\[1\]](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQHS6xJJpVG/) [\[2\]](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQOApwrpwSW/) [\[3\]](https://www.tiktok.com/@freedomtour21/video/6973621561584618758)
