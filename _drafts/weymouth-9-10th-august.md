The Freedom Tour is coming to Weymouth. Below are our plans.

## Monday

We will be setting up our van and canvassing station somewhere.

We will bring our tea urns, biscuits, smiles and flyers. We will be engaging people in conversation to find out what they think about crisis and the state of Weymouth within the wider UK and human condition. What gives them hope and what are they wanting to change.

The aim in our conversations is for us to learn from those we speak to, exchange new viewpoints and paradigms, and ultimately invite people to day's [Crisis Talk](freedomtour.uk/crisis-talk).

## Tuesday

#### Daytime

We will continue our outreach somewhere in Weymouth.

#### 6pm - The Crisis Talk

The Crisis Talk will take place at **Weymouth Beach**. Everyone welcome.

#### Campaigns we hope to hear from at the Crisis Talk
